Description: A package to calculate and illustrate overlap statistics. Functions
    include those for importing .csv and .xml files describing gene set
    annotations and gene set contents; those for parsing gene name and gene
    value input from a text string; and those for calculating enrichment
    statistics given the above. Additionally, functions for plotting said
    statistics, as well as gene-annotation matches, are included.
